	<h1>Artificial Intelligence in Test</h1>
	<h2>Methodology used:</h2>
	<p>The methodology used in the study involved collecting data from online sources using web scraping techniques and analyzing the data using statistical and machine learning methods. The goal was to identify patterns and trends in the data related to the research questions.</p>
	<h2>Explanation:</h2>
	<p>This article discusses the application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automatic testing of systems and circuit cards. The author emphasizes that AI is not a "magic bullet" and its successful use requires an understanding of both the technology and the repair process it is being applied to. The article discusses the various methods of AI as a toolkit and explains that each tool is applicable to specific types of jobs. The author explores the reasons why AI is often hard to apply effectively to test in a generalized fashion and suggests some solutions to the problems. The article also defines AI and explains that it is the application of computer algorithms to simulate or emulate human reasoning, with the goal of developing optimized solutions to narrowly defined problems.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
	<p>Applying artificial intelligence to automatic test can bring benefits, but it requires a proper understanding of the technology and the repair process it is being applied to. AI is not a "magic bullet," and its success depends on realistic expectations, effective communication, and building on the experiences of others.</p>
